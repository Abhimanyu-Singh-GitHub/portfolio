          <p>Summer 2021 Internship, I worked on a team of Computer Engineering Interns and Civil Engineers 
              to continue to develop a Flood Early Warning System for the City of Bryan. This project contained many 
              facets, including a first of it's kind, IoT based wireless communication hiearchy that controls all aspects
              of the Flood Warning System. This oppurtunity really helped me build a professional presence, I was able to 
              meet many engineers and city technicians, I got to partake in professional meetings that both related to our 
              project, and also some that did not. The work environment was that of a small start up company, and I learned 
              how to communicate within this team. The work was fun, hard, but most importantly, it was very rewarding.

          <h3>Electric Go Kart</h3>
          <p>I built an Electric Go Kart in the summer of 2019, I bought an old rusted go kart and sanded down the frame 
              and welded the front wheel arms as they weren't reinforced. The go kart recieved a paint job, then I fitted 
            it with a 2kW Brushless DC motor, and a 48V 12Ah battery system and controller. After completing this build, I 
            realized that the battery technology for this specifi use case was not readily available for under a good amount 
            money. The sealed lead acid batteries that I used were simply not able to discharge at a rate fast enough to give 
            me the right to push the motor to its limit. After this I decided to fit a tuned 4 stroke lawnmower engine 
            this gave me more top speed and a much larger range as well. I miss the electric motor's torque, but the high revs
            of the 212cc is a lot of fun around corners.  </p>
